<h2 id="what-is-augmented-reality">*What is augmented reality?</h2>
<p>Augmented reality is the combination of the real-world and content that is generated by a computer. According to the definition augmented reality can be described using three features: 
1.Combination of the real and virtual worlds
2.Real-Time interaction
3.Accurate 3 dimensional registration of virtual and real objects</p>

<p>The most important benefit of augmented reality is that elements of the virtual world seamlessly blend with our perception of the real world. Augmented reality is used to enhance natural environments or situations and offer perceptually enriched experiences. That can be very helpful when training the next generation of surgeons.</p>

<p>Students can interactively participate. Instead of being a passive recipient of the information, they can become active learners. Computer-generated simulations of patients allow students to explore and learn in detail the different situations without the risk of studying an actual patient.</p>

<h2 id="medical-augmented-reality">*Medical augmented reality</h2>

<p>“AR has the potential to revolutionize medicine. During surgery, AR systems provide medical imaging data and other patient information superimposed on the operation area in the most intuitive way. Furthermore, AR aided navigation systems can reduce the risk of complications and improve the safety and quality of surgeries, AR education systems train the surgeons of tomorrow to acquire the critical skills and AR rehabilitation concepts help patients to recover faster after interventions. However, while research is rapidly evolving in the field of Medical Augmented Reality, strong relationships between doctors, engineers and industry are the key for the development and implementation of new AR systems in medicine.” Stated on the medical augmented reality website.</p>

<h2 id="strengths-of-augmented-reality-in-healthcare-education">*Strengths of augmented reality in healthcare education</h2>

<p>1.Augmented reality is implemented in several healthcare areas and is 2.aimed at learners at all levels.
2.Augmented reality is useful for improving healthcare education.
3.Augmented reality has a broad focus.</p>

<h2 id="weaknesses-of-augmented-reality-in-healthcare-education">*Weaknesses of augmented reality in healthcare education</h2>

<p>1.Lack of learning theories to guide the design of the augmented reality
2.Continuation of traditional learning strategies
3.Lack of studies on the impacts of augmented reality</p>

<h2 id="top-cases-of-use-of-augmented-reality-in-healthcare">*Top cases of use of augmented reality in healthcare</h2>

<p>1.Learning anatomy: Human anatomy is one of the most important courses of medical studies and one of the most common uses of augmented reality in healthcare education. Augmented reality helps learners to interact with a 3 dimensional model of the body. Human Anatomy Atlas is an example of these types of applications.</p>

<p>2.Practicing surgery: Before the use of augmented reality, students would practice on mannequins and cadavers in order to train precision motor skills. But that was not close enough to the situation in an operation room. Augmented reality can create virtual patients and environments, which is significantly more realistic and educational. Different scenarios can be played and the patient would even react to the actions of the student. Medicalholodeck, is one of the examples of that.</p>

<p>3.Assisting mentors remotely during emergencies: When a medical emergency occurs the appropriate medical specialist may not always be available. It could be because the emergency has happened in a remote area or that there is no specialist on call. In these situations someone with nonsufficient medical background must perform the procedure. In these instances a medical professional could guide the person performing the procedure remotely, using platforms like PProximine.</p>

<p>4.Training first responders: “AR offers more opportunities when it comes to emergency response training for medical and nonmedical personnel. Paramedics, police, and firefighters arrive at emergency sites first, and they need to be empowered to provide first aid confidently and quickly.
5.Trainers can use AR to recreate emergencies: instead of seeing mannequins, trainees can see virtual patients with applications like PerSim, developed by medtech startup MedCognition. PerSim is easily configured to simulate various health conditions: it can simulate sweat, sounds, and various vital signs like respiration rate.” (Velichko, 2022, para 19-20)</p>

<p>Outside of education, augmented reality has other uses in healthcare that can help the patients as well as the doctors. Some of the ways that augmented reality can be used in healthcare as a whole are:</p>

<p>6.Wound care management: Without the use of augmented reality, figuring out the parameters of a wound can be painful and rough for the patient and more importantly, inaccurate. With augmented reality the wound parameters can be assessed non-invasively and the healing status can be studied.</p>

<p>7.Physical therapy and rehabilitation: Usage of augmented reality in physical therapy and rehabilitation not only motivate the patient to work harder, but provide a safe environment to test and practice. After each session of therapy the data can be accessed and the progress tracked. Using this data the course of the rest of the therapy can be decided.</p>

<p>8.Accurate symptom detection: Oftentimes describing symptoms correctly is a challenge for patients. This miscommunication can lead to misdiagnosis which then leads to the wrong treatment. That in the best case will be ineffective and in the worst case can be fatal. Augmented reality tackles this issue and tries to minimize the risk of miscommunication.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-augmented-reality-in-healthcare">*The future of augmented reality in healthcare</h2>

<p>Surgeons use multiple different techniques in order to have a visual understanding of their patients. Use of augmented reality improves accuracy and the surgeon’s field of view. But it’s not only the doctors that benefit from augmented reality. A patient can have a better understanding of their situation and the different options on how to continue with their treatment when their condition is explained to them using augmented reality.
The advances in technology have reduced the cost of augmented reality devices and can contribute to widening of the use of augmented reality. 
Augmented reality not only gives a more effective education to students, it lowers the costs of the education. On the other hand, the experience of studying using augmented reality makes students all the more interested in their studies.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">*Discussion</h2>
<p>Augmented reality has come a long way and is helping countless people with their medical issues. It has also made studying medicine exciting, more effective and easier. But I believe it has a long way to go. There is a lot of work to be done for augmented reality to be a mainstream tool in healthcare, but it is worth the effort because it will solve many problems that we are facing right now.</p>
